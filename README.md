# NICE: Non-linear Independent Components Estimation

NICE (Non-linear Independent Components Estimation) is a flow-based generative model for density estimation and sample generation, leveraging reversible transformations for efficient computation.

This repository implements both Additive and Affine coupling layers, tested on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Results include loss plots and generated samples.
